#### Describe Cloud Concepts (20-25%)

### Benefits of cloud computing

- Cost savings- both real and accounting
- Agility
- Availibility (natural disasters 99.99% for single region, 4min down in a month)
- Security
- Global reach (run data centers across countries)
- Range of redy on-demand services
- Range of tools

### Cost Benefits and Scaling

## Cost Savings

- cost saving is greater when you run server on azure rther that on premise

# Cost Savings - Real

- Total cost of ownership(TCO) - electricity, Internet, cooling, employees
- v vCpu server - as low as $187/month
- also u only have to pay when server is running

# Global Reach

- cloud allows you to expand your application deployements to diferent regions in th world
- natural disaters could not harm your application if it is sprea across the world

# Scalibility ( ability to handle growth)

- when no.of concurrent users cross max capacity of server then app fails

# elasticity (systems automatic grow and shrink based on app demand)

### 7. Agility benefits and accounting

 Agility: You can have an idea, spin up the servers for 3 hrs for just few dollars and the can shut it down

## Disaster Recovery

- Azure SQL database is going tohave ability to roll back snapshots
- If power goes down the application will run run fromdifferent region
- You can back upeasily

## Capital Expenditure and Operational Expenditure(OpEx)

- CapEx: upfront money invested in typical on premises data servers
- OpEx: have that budget in advance say project needs 10000 dollars a month to run the servers and that is part of the budget (its not a capital investment its an operationa expenditure)

## Consumption based model

- pay per minute
- pay per hour
- pay per execution
  pay per cpu utilization

### 8. Overview of Cloud Models

- Iaas: virtual machines
- Paas: web apps , app services
- Saas: dropbox, google docs, zoho, Microsoft 365 (anything you use web browser to access the service)
        Active directory is a product that runs in cloud as saas

### Shared responsibility Model

### Azure Serverless Offers (if no user visit ur website no billing charges)
compute- Azure functions
compute- Servelerless Kubernetes (Virtual Nodes x/ACI)
database- Azure Sql Database Server
DAtabase- Cosmos Db serverlesss

#### Describe Core Azure Services (15-20%)4

## Core Azure architectural components

# Regions

- 60+ (not accesible by everyone eg.china us government )

# Region pairs

- eg:   Canada Canada Central - Canada East
        Europe                - North Europe - West Europe
        USA                   - East Us - West Us
        USA                   - East US 2 - Central US
        USA                   - North Central US - Sounth Central US
        Brazil                - Brazil South - South Central US

### 13. Azure Subscriptions and Management Group

## Availability Zones

Each Region have indipendant availability zones (indepedent power, network, cooling sysytem)

## Resource Groups

Management Groups
        |
        v
Subscriptions
        |
        v
Resource Groups
        |
        v
Resources

## Azure Subscription

- its a billing unit (credit card required)
- users have access to one or more subscriptions, with different roles
- its different from userId and password that you use  to log in

## Azure Resource Manager

- Tools: portal, commandline, visual studio 
- All azure resource manager api is responsible to affect the resources

#### Azure Services 

- compute services
- networking services
- storage services
- database services
- azure marketplace

### 17. Azure compute resources
## Compute serveices (executing code in cloud)

- virtual machines
- app services
- azure container instances (ACI)
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Windows virtual Desktop

# Virtual Machines
- Iaas
- take an existing machine from yoour environment into the cloud - a copy
- windows or linux os (several of each)
- A 'slice' of a physical machine shared with other customers
- Full control over it, as if it was your machine
- (memory optimised(more ram), cpu optimised(more cores), storage optimised(more memory hrd disk))

# App Services
- Paas
- new paradigm for running code
- Give your code and configuration to Azure , and they will run it
- promise of performnce but no access hardware
- plam typs (Basic, Standard, Premium)

# Containers
- another paradign for running code in cloud
- containers contain everything the app needs to run in a 'container image'
- Fastest and easiest to deploy
- ACI - single instance , quickest way to deploy a container
- AKS -runs on a cluster of servers, enterprise-grade

# Widows Virtual Desktop

- Desktop version of Windows tht runs in the cloud
- you s/w installed, your files - avilable from anywhere
- can even see you desktop on ios and android, or from any web browser
- Runs on Azure

### 18.Azure Network Resources
eg.
- Virtual networks
- VPN Gateway
- VNEt Peering
- ExpressRoute

## Networking services Types
- Connectivity Serices
- Protection Services
- Delivery Services
- Monitoring Services

# Connectivity Services
- Virtual Network( emulating a physical network)
  Microsoft Global Network already exists, so a vn is just a software configuration
- VPN (connecting two networks as if they were on the same network, using a network gateway)
- ExpressRoute- (high-speed private connection to Azure)

# Protection 
- DDos Protection - Distributed Denial of Service attack protection
- Azure Firewall
- Network security groups
- Private Link

# Delivery (not on exam)

- Load Balancer - distribute traffic evenly between multiplebackend servers
- CDN (Content Delivery Network)
- Application Gateway
- Azure Front Door Service (its a mix of all)

# Monitoring

- Network watcher
- ExpressRouteMoniter
- Azure Monitor

### 19. creating a virtual network

### 20 creating virtual machine

->Azure portal > search virtual machine> Windows Server 2016 Datacenter

- give same region as given to viryual network

- Admisterator account is windows accout for virtual machine

- make sure to delete all resources created by vm

### 21 creating storage account
- select hot/cold/archive
- generap purpose v2
- tables, blobs and queues

### 22. connecting storage account

- properties (url)
- access keys (connection string)

### 25.Databases services

- Cosmos Db
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure DAtabase fro MYSQl
- Azure Database fro Postgres
- SQL Managed Instance

## Cosmos DB

- Extremely fast Storage
- Designed for modern applications such as mobile video games, social networks
- NoSql storage
- multi- modal
- Supports many open-source API's and protocols

#### Describe Core solutions and Management Tools (10-15%)

- Sphere Os
- cloud-based security services

## Big Data Analytics

- HdInsight (Hadoop products)
- Azure Databricks (single workspace to make sense of data to all faculty)

# Notes:
- microsoft offers managed hadoop services (Apache stark, Apache Hive, Apache kafka)
- these products comes under umbrell of HDInsight
- Jupiter notebook,you can access database annotate results to make them as report

# Azure Databricks demo

- create a azure databricks frpm marketplace
- launch workspace
